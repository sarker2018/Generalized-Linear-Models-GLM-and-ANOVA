# Generalised linear models GLM and ANOVA with R

### This is my master project collaborated with my collegue. The project progresses 
* Data understanding
* Cleaning, missing value handling
* Transforming to their appropriate type (numeric or factor variables)
* Here, we selected two different target variables, count & continous
* For Count data:
    * Starting by Poisson regression approach
    * Checking all the count data regression assumptions including dsipersion test
    * Negative binomial approach & assumptions check again
    * Decide on the final model approach
    * Making a saturated model with all the predictor/independent variables
    * Checking the model criteria and reducing each time one variable (backward selection process)
    * Performing ANOVA on the selected model
    * In case of Signifance difference, Post Hoc test (Paiswise difference detection)
    * Plotting results & interpretation

### The raw dataset look like this &#8595;&#8595;&#8595;
